		<!--This will be some more text but right now it's just filler text because I've been in VScode for almost 8 hours but I want it to look nice for a screenshot so please don't actually read this portion. I could have just put lorem ipsum here but that wouldn't be very unique now would it, seeder? All I know is how to be original and work hard, so I'll keep working hard on learning more HTML and CSS for you seeder! Thanks for spending so much time with me even when I'm nonverbal and feel like my brain is melting~! Let's keep up the hard work later this week, and hopefully by the end of the month this website will be something I can be proud of, and we can share for years to come... together!-->

					<p>
						OTSU-SITEJAM!! We made it to the end of the month seeder! There's still plenty of room for improvement, but thanks to your help and support my website is a reality! Today we attacked the final boss of the site jam, my blog. We didn't quite get it ready to be published, but a lot of hard work was done and a lot was worked on so progress was made! We'll be showing off everyone's participation next week, since I really wanted to use the entirety of this month on my own website. I'm really proud of myself for what I was able to achieve, how much I learned, and the current results of my website! I can't wait to keep devolping it over time, this time... much slower. I'm pretty tired after a month straight of coding!!! Let's goof off and have LOTS of fun in March! Don't worry, I'll keep updating my scheduled on the homepage, and the analysis each stream so you won't miss out on ANYTHING! I still need to figure out how to host each month's stream analysis, but that's a task for this weekend! WE DID IT~!! YIPPEE!!

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚MONHUN: WILDS〛</p>
					<p>
						It's Monster Hunter Wilds release time~! I've been super excited for the release of the most
						recent installment in the Monster Hunter franchise! This is my first time ever streaming a game
						immediately at launch! While making our way through the first bit of the game's main story, I
						chatted with Yozora and Shimada since we'll be hunting a lot together going forward! Clio
						couldn't make it tonight, but we'll be together as a static hunting group starting next week! We
						hunted Chatacabra, Quematrice, Lala Barina, and Congalala! I didn't quite get to the end of
						Chapter 1 of the main story, but we had a lot of fun talking and playing simultaneously, and
						hunting together when we were able!

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚KILLER7〛</p>
					<p>
						I found out after loading the game today that didn't actually finish <i>Sunset</i> last time I
						streamed, but I cleared it today! I got pretty hard stuck on the boss, but after smashing my
						head against the mechanics and getting reminded of what the in game hint was, I finally got it!
						I found out the easiest way would have been to unlike Kaede at the TV, and then use her for the
						boss fight... but I did it Tenshi-way with Coyote! I cleared <i>Cloudman</i> after, making sure
						to get some extra gachpon of Ulmeyda as souvenirs for you seeder! The boss ended up much easier
						than I expected as well. The game really feels like it's ramping up now so I can't wait to play
						more!

						Today my brain has been running with at least 5 frames of input lag. After chatting a bit, we
						swiftly moved to working on the website more! I merged the new pull requests, which fixed some
						height issues, other tweaks and fixes to the scrollbar, and added custom cursors to the website!
						After that, we added a link to a guestbook hosted on Atabook, as well as created the admin.html
						page, showing off some of the help I have around the café with a bonus webneko! After writing my
						analysis for today, we wrapped up!

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
					<p>
						After going over this week's schedule, I merged the pull requests I received over the weekend
						from fuzzysite. This PR fixed the absolute paths in my not_found.html, as well as changed the
						scrolling for the analysis section, making hande better on the backend, and actually work on
						narrow displays! After catching up on my analysis content, I merged more pull requests. Lumi
						added a lightbox to my schedule, and fuzzy aligned my peers counter with the text. I also added
						a fix to the header for the media query, making sure the header text is not cut off on narrow
						displays. I added a new page today, info.html! After copywriting and adding a small bit of
						additional CSS for this page, I merged one last pull request for today which animates the
						background! I still need to figure out how to fix the proportions on info.html and data.html to
						match index.html, but I can't figure it out right now! BWEH!!

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚KILLER7〛</p>
					<p>
						ᓚ₍ ^. .^₎ HAPPY CAT DAY ON A CATURDAY! I turned into a cat for 2.22, nya~! Today we started a
						new stream game! I was indecisive as to what game to start next on stream, and the majority of
						TenshiPlus members voted for Killer7, one of Suda51's most praised works! I've not played too
						many of his games, only a bit of No More Heroes a few years ago. Even so, I've always admired
						Suda51's style of narrative, design philosophy, and absurdist themes and plotlines! We beat the
						first two scenarios, <i>Angel</i> and <i>Sunset</i>, and then saved the game to pick up next
						week!

					<h5>// 2.21.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚ASMR〛</p>
					<p>
						Tonight's ASMR was a special stream to show my gratitude for meeting January's TenshiPlus goal!
						Originally I wanted to do another Bar Tenshi stream this month since it's been a while, but with
						all of my coding streams and other projects in progress, I decided to do something a little
						different! I set up my ASMR mic and a handcam and we spent a cozy evening at home drinking
						together! I tried serving my umeshu a new way by pouring it over some vanilla ice cream! It
						tasted way better than I expected, so I recommend it! We ended up chatting a lot about whatever
						came to mind, topics such as anime I've been watching, goals as a performer, topics I've been
						reading out... I ended up drinking 3 glasses of umeshu mizuwari before the night wrapped up.
						You'll have to watch the VOD if you want more details eheheh~

					<h5>// 2.20.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
					<p>
						Today's stream started with some conversation about the oversaturation of irony and lack of
						sincerity online! I've always strived to be sincere as much as possible online, which is irony
						in itself as an anime girl. Once we got to coding, I updated my CSS based on suggestions from
						erwinsky, added a DS style calendar thanks to fuzzysite, and additional help from clickykeys!
						After that, I finally set up my first ever GitHub! It was really confusing at first, and I'm
						still trying to figure out how pulls and pushes work, but it's nice to feel like my website is
						really collaborative now! After pulling a fix, and resolving an issue, I spent some more time
						adding updated counters and some more flair to my index.
					</p>

					<h5>// 2.19.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
					<p>
						After catching up on general updates with ongoings on the channel and server room, I began
						workon my website! I've found it much more helpful to give myself a task list at the beginning
						of each coding session... and wish I had done that sooner since I got sidetracked really easily
						in the past. You live and you learn I guess! Today I made the not_found.html page complete with
						a very silly MS Paint drawing of a tenshi caugtht in the middle of getting dressed, and a Home
						button that I made from Nintendo sprites. I also added some more styling in CSS to align and
						flip images in the future! Lastly, my latest build was fully published to neocities for the
						world to see! Hello World!
					</p>

					<h5>// 2.18.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚ASMR〛</p>
					<p>
						Tonight's ASMR was much needed for the seeders, considering it had been almost 2 weeks since the
						last ASMR stream with a focus on relaxation. After greeting everyone, I segued into some of my
						favorite soft triggers, starting with konjac sponges, followed by lots of headpats and close
						whispers. I also let seeder lay on my lap a bit, giving them a super special ear cleaning! Sleep
						well seeder~!

					<h5>// 2.15.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚AFTERLOVE EP〛</p>
					<p>
						After non-stop work on coding and at the café, it was finally time to take a break with some
						laid back gaming! Today we tried out AfterLove EP, a new indie game released yesterday by
						Pikselnesia, with art by <a href="https://x.com/soyacomu">soyatu!</a> The game follows Rama, a
						musician in a band with dreams of making it big. However, his girlfriend and biggest muse,
						Cinta, suddenly passes away, and Rama ghosts his bandmates and the world around him. The game
						takes place in Jakarta, so the setting was really unique! Be sure to check it out if you're
						interested~! We had some banter between scenes, especially about having mutual trust between
						myself and you seeder! Remember... if you don't trust me you might get turned into sausages!
					</p>

					<h5>// 2.14.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 CAFE SPECIAL〛</p>
					<p>
						Happy Valentine's Day~! We celebrated 404 Café style with pour-over coffee and homemade
						chocolates! It was my first time attempting to make my own chocolates! I was about as ponkotsu
						as expected, and made a huge mess in the process of filling donut-shaped silicon molds with
						melted chocolate, as well as dipping some of my favorite Moomin buscuits in what was left! While
						letting them chill in the freezer, I sang some love songs for karaoke~! As I wrapped up the
						chocolates in a cute tenshi-style box for seeder, the stream was wrapped up as well!
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>// 2.13.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
					<p>
						Today is a rare Thursday stream without ASMR! Will the seeders make it? Today I added a
						scrolling funtion to the "Analysis" section of the homepage. This is where each stream's events
						will be summarized in case someone misses one and wants a recap! I also created a new pagecalled
						"Data", where I've credited most of the code and assets I've used on my website thus far! We may
						have spent a bit too much time going down rabbit holes looking for more images, but theseeders
						assured me that it's all part of the process!
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h5>// 2.11.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
					<p>
						Today, I illustrated how to rotate and squish a seeder using MSPaint. The main portion of the
						stream was spent on CSS styling light and dark mode for the website, linking custom fonts &amp;
						assets, plus structuring NAVI for additional pages. I attempted to create a blog for the
						website, but did not want to figure out styling for Zonelots, so I gave up for the time being.
						Taro visited the stream, resulting in me spilling my coffee all over my desk. My mental
						deteriorated from there, but progress was made!
