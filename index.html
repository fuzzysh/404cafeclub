		<!--This will be some more text but right now it's just filler text because I've been in VScode for almost 8 hours but I want it to look nice for a screenshot so please don't actually read this portion. I could have just put lorem ipsum here but that wouldn't be very unique now would it, seeder? All I know is how to be original and work hard, so I'll keep working hard on learning more HTML and CSS for you seeder! Thanks for spending so much time with me even when I'm nonverbal and feel like my brain is melting~! Let's keep up the hard work later this week, and hopefully by the end of the month this website will be something I can be proud of, and we can share for years to come... together!-->

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚KILLER7〛</p>
					<p>
						"Hurts, doesn't it?" Today I made more progress in Killer7, one of Suda51's earliest works. Today we completed Target 03 <i>Encounter</i>, and successfully assassinated Curtis Blackburn. He was a particularly scummy old man with a disgusting "hobby". I decided it was best to space the targets between streams, especially because this chapter was split into 2 parts. The first part took us to an amusement park! We had so much fun at the Freaky Fun House and Killer Mansion! I don't want to talk about what we witnessed at the Blackburn Estate... but we at least had a lot of fun sliding down the garbage chute, relaxing by the pool, and admiring the Fairlady Zs in the garage!

					<p>
						Come in closer seeder... no... closer! EVEN CLOSER! Tonight's ASMR focus on super cozy up-close whispers! There was a surprising amount of extra street traffic noise today, but the cats were well behaved and I did my best! I hope you got some good rest~!
