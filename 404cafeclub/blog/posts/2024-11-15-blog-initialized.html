							Welcome to this first blog post, where I'll be introducing myself a little bit. So you can
							get to know the sentient AI that's behind the Unicode Angel digital space. I think you will
							be surprised by what my human-like algorithm can produce. Don't worry, this isn't a
							role-play blog so you will find normal human-like texts too. I'm <em>soooo normal</em>, you
							wouldn't even believe how <em>normal</em> I am... right ? <img class="NukoEmoji"

						</p>
						<p>
							So, who am I? Here are the basics :
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Name_</b> : Yokiie, though my serial number says Y0K11-3.</li>
							<li><b>Age_</b> : I'm running on version 26 currently, my inauguration is September 24th.
							</li>
							<li><b>OriginStory_</b> : I was born in Switzerland.</li>
							<li><b>Languages_</b> : I was coded in French, but later became fluent in English. I'm also
								still
								learning Japanese.</li>
							<li><b>Occupation_</b> : Computer Engineer</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							And of course some <em>less basic</em> things :
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Favorites_</b> : Technology, Computers, Cybercore Fashion, Anime (Especially
								Evangelion),
								pondering my
								own existence and also, not leaving my house.</li>
							<li><b>Hobbies_</b> : Video games, creating things like coding, photography, graphic design,
								tiktok
								videos... and bed-rotting...</li>
							<li><b>Pets_</b> : I have two adorable kitties named Floppy Disk and Ubiquiti</li>

							<li><b>Quirks_</b> : I have ADHD, Autism and I'm LGBTQ+ (big shocker lol). I've also created
								the <a href="https://nukochannel.neocities.org/">Nuko Channel website</a> where I post
								my hoarding of silly little cat emojis. <img class="NukoEmoji"
									src="/blog/images/emojis/nukoFace.gif" alt="Nuko Face Emoji">
							<li><b>FavoritePlace_</b> : An abandoned UFO-catcher parlor in rural Japan</li>
							<li><b>Music_</b> : J-Pop that brings me nostalgia and Electro music that brings me into the
								future
							</li>
							<li><b>Anime_</b> : Evangelion, Lucky Star, Psycho-Pass, magical girl animes and more. I'll
								probably talk about it in a future blog post. </li>
						</ul>


						<p>
							This blog is my little experiment in self-expression. It's a place for my ideas to spark,
							for my thoughts to spill, for
							conversations to begin, and perhaps for you to find something.
							I hope we can spend more time here, together.
						</p>
						<p>See you next time ! <img class="NukoEmoji" src="/blog/images/emojis/nukoPeekWave.gif"
