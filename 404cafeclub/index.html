		<!--This will be some more text but right now it's just filler text because I've been in VScode 
			for almost 8 hours but I want it to look nice for a screenshot so please don't actually read this portion.
			I could have just put lorem ipsum here but that wouldn't be very unique now would it, seeder? All I know is how to be original and work hard, so I'll keep working hard on learning more HTML and CSS for you seeder! Thanks for spending so much time with me even when I'm nonverbal and feel like my brain is melting~! Let's keep up the hard work later this week, and hopefully by the end of the month this website will be something I can be proud of, and we can share for years to come... together!-->

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
					<p>
						After going over this week's schedule, I merged the pull requests I received over the weekend from fuzzysite. This PR fixed the absolute paths in my not_found.html, as well as changed the scrolling for the analysis section, making hande better on the backend, and actually work on narrow displays! After catching up on my analysis content, I merged more pull requests. Lumi added a lightbox to my schedule, and fuzzy aligned my peers counter with the text. I also added a fix to the header for the media query, making sure the header text is not cut off on narrow displays. I added a new page today, info.html! After copywriting and adding a small bit of additional CSS for this page, I merged one last pull request for today which animates the background! I still need to figure out how to fix the proportions on info.html and data.html to match index.html, but I can't figure it out right now! BWEH!!

					<p>
						ᓚ₍ ^. .^₎ HAPPY CAT DAY ON A CATURDAY! I turned into a cat for 2.22, nya~! Today we started a new stream game! I was indecisive as to what game to start next on stream, and the majority of TenshiPlus members voted for Killer7, one of Suda51's most praised works! I've not played too many of his games, only a bit of No More Heroes a few years ago. Even so, I've always admired Suda51's style of narrative, design philosophy, and absurdist themes and plotlines! We beat the first two scenarios, <i>Angel</i> and <i>Sunset</i>, and then saved the game to pick up next week!

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚ASMR〛</p>
					<p>
						Tonight's ASMR was a special stream to show my gratitude for meeting January's TenshiPlus goal! Originally I wanted to do another Bar Tenshi stream this month since it's been a while, but with all of my coding streams and other projects in progress, I decided to do something a little different! I set up my ASMR mic and a handcam and we spent a cozy evening at home drinking together! I tried serving my umeshu a new way by pouring it over some vanilla ice cream! It tasted way better than I expected, so I recommend it! We ended up chatting a lot about whatever came to mind, topics such as anime I've been watching, goals as a performer, topics I've been reading out... I ended up drinking 3 glasses of umeshu mizuwari before the night wrapped up. You'll have to watch the VOD if you want more details eheheh~

					<h5>// 2.20.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
					<p>
						Today's stream started with some conversation about the oversaturation of irony and lack of sincerity online! I've always strived to be sincere as much as possible online, which is irony in itself as an anime girl. Once we got to coding, I updated my CSS based on suggestions from erwinsky, added a DS style calendar thanks to fuzzysite, and additional help from clickykeys! After that, I finally set up my first ever GitHub! It was really confusing at first, and I'm still trying to figure out how pulls and pushes work, but it's nice to feel like my website is really collaborative now! After pulling a fix, and resolving an issue, I spent some more time adding updated counters and some more flair to my index.

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
					<p>
						After catching up on general updates with ongoings on the channel and server room, I began workon my website! I've found it much more helpful to give myself a task list at the beginning of each coding session... and wish I had done that sooner since I got sidetracked really easily in the past. You live and you learn I guess! Today I made the not_found.html page complete with a very silly MS Paint drawing of a tenshi caugtht in the middle of getting dressed, and a Home button that I made from Nintendo sprites. I also added some more styling in CSS to align and flip images in the future! Lastly, my latest build was fully published to neocities for the world to see! Hello World!

					<h5>// 2.18.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚ASMR〛</p>
					<p>
						Tonight's ASMR was much needed for the seeders, considering it had been almost 2 weeks since the last ASMR stream with a focus on relaxation. After greeting everyone, I segued into some of my favorite soft triggers, starting with konjac sponges, followed by lots of headpats and close whispers. I also let seeder lay on my lap a bit, giving them a super special ear cleaning! Sleep well seeder~!

					<h5>// 2.15.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚AFTERLOVE EP〛</p>
					<p>
						After non-stop work on coding and at the café, it was finally time to take a break with some laid back gaming! Today we tried out AfterLove EP, a new indie game released yesterday by Pikselnesia, with art by <a href="https://x.com/soyacomu">soyatu!</a> The game follows Rama, a musician in a band with dreams of making it big. However, his girlfriend and biggest muse, Cinta, suddenly passes away, and Rama ghosts his bandmates and the world around him. The game takes place in Jakarta, so the setting was really unique! Be sure to check it out if you're interested~! We had some banter between scenes, especially about having mutual trust between myself and you seeder! Remember... if you don't trust me you might get turned into sausages!

					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 CAFE SPECIAL〛</p>
					<p>
						Happy Valentine's Day~! We celebrated 404 Café style with pour-over coffee and homemade chocolates! It was my first time attempting to make my own chocolates! I was about as ponkotsu as expected, and made a huge mess in the process of filling donut-shaped silicon molds with melted chocolate, as well as dipping some of my favorite Moomin buscuits in what was left! While letting them chill in the freezer, I sang some love songs for karaoke~! As I wrapped up the chocolates in a cute tenshi-style box for seeder, the stream was wrapped up as well!

					<h5>// 2.13.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
					<p>
						Today is a rare Thursday stream without ASMR! Will the seeders make it? Today I added a scrolling funtion to the "Analysis" section of the homepage. This is where each stream's events will be summarized in case someone misses one and wants a recap! I also created a new page called "Data", where I've credited most of the code and assets I've used on my website thus far! We may have spent a bit too much time going down rabbit holes looking for more images, but the seeders assured me that it's all part of the process!

					<h5>// 2.11.25 //</h5>
					<p class="analysis-heading">〚404 SITEJAM〛</p>
					<p>
						Today, I illustrated how to rotate and squish a seeder using MSPaint. The main portion of the stream was spent on CSS styling light and dark mode for the website, linking custom fonts &amp; assets, plus structuring NAVI for additional pages. I attempted to create a blog for the website, but did not want to figure out styling for Zonelots, so I gave up for the time being. Taro visited the stream, resulting in me spilling her coffee all over my desk. My mental deteriorated from there, but progress was made!
